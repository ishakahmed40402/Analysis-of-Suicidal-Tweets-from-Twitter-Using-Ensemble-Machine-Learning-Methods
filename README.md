# Analysis-of-Suicidal-Tweets-from-Twitter-Using-Ensemble-Machine-Learning-Methods
In this project, I collected a dataset of 3998 suicidal and 5121 non-suicidal tweets from Twitter through the Tweepy API. After preprocessing the tweets, I applied several traditional and ensemble machine learning models. The best-performing model was the ensemble voting classifier, which combined logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM, achieving 90.4% accuracy.
